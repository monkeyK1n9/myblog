# Introduction

You are surely wondering, what are you doing here? Why am I reading this? Well, here I write about my thoughts, and if you found your way down here, you surely found something useful.

My friends call me King, the monkey_K1n9. Yeah! I'm a nerd and I talk about nerd stuff.

# Tell us more

I was experimenting with Next.JS and here I am, building a blog post in my free time. By the time you are reading this, I may have crafted another geek stuff to do some geek stuff. I am curious, fanatic and gosshhhh, I love to build stuff. Sharing is caring. In this blog, you will find more of how I do some things, more of me, more of my coding experiences.

Stay tuned!
